# Team profile generator

## Description
The Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. In addition to building the application, this project also required the use of Jest to conduct unit tests of every part of the code to ensure that it would pass each test. Before running the application the user must perform an npm install to install all required dependencies.
